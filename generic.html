								<b>An Overview</b>: </p><p>Plasticity is the idea that our brains change and adapt to new situations. The most plasticity occurs during early childhood, when the brain is developing and adjusting to all of the new experiences and stimulation. There is neurogenesis (creation of new neurons) and synaptogenesis (creation of new synapses -- the pathways between the neurons). What happens when you are a kid is that your brain is rapidly creating pathways based on your experiences - you’re trying new things, experimenting, playing. As you get older, you notice patterns and the pathways become more efficient, and the ones you don’t use as much fade away. This is called pruning. Pruning continues into the mid 20s. Once you reach 30, your brain is pretty set in its ways, with efficient pathways. This explains why it is way easier to learn a language when you are young. Your brain is ready to form new connections with any new information. When you are older, your connections are stronger, and fewer, and you don’t readily form new ones.

							<b>Musings</b>:
							</p><p>	
								How much of the decrease in plasticity into adulthood is a result of our culture? If we had a culture that promoted play and risk taking in adulthood, perhaps that would lead to a longer period of plasticy. 

								Are there certain activities or mindsets that enable our brains to be plastic for longer? Research has shown that activity and diet can affect neurogenesis in adults. 

								How does plasticity relate to empathy, being open to new ideas, and understanding others perspectives? If one were to measure neurogenesis, would there be a correlation between adult neurogenesis and innovation or empathy?
